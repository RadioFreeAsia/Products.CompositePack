- create two folders in the skin 
      compositepack/layouts
      compositepack/viewlets

- setup of composable should happen in composite_tool rather than in
  kupu_library_tool

- viewlets should use macros (to structure a bit the HTML included), named
  "portlet" (to be able to reuse portlets as well)

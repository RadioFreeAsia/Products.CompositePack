- create two folders in the skin 
      compositepack/layouts
      compositepack/viewlets

- setup of composable should happen in composite_tool rather than in
  kupu_library_tool

- viewlets should use macros (to structure a bit the HTML included), named
  "portlet" (to be able to reuse portlets as well)

- createCompoFragment and createCompoTitle cause problems when another
  user deleted the navigation page and the current user tried to add
  Title or HTML. When the user tries to add content, he gets a
  javascript error (unknown origin).

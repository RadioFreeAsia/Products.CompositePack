- create two folders in the skin 
      compositepack/layouts
      compositepack/viewlets

- setup of composable should happen in composite_tool rather than in
  kupu_library_tool

- viewlets should use macros (to structure a bit the HTML included), named
  "portlet" (to be able to reuse portlets as well)

- add exception handling to moveAndDelete (if two people are designing the
  same navigation page at the same time, elements might be unavailable
  because of changes by the other user)

- plone 2.1 compat

  * smart ids

  * replace layouts by templatemixin ?

Plone 2.5 compatibility
=======================

  * some tests are failing (regarding CMFStaging)

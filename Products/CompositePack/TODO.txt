- fix installer because right now it's a complete mess; we need to add one
  step at a time, starting with content types and moving beyond.

- fix tests setup to standarize the way we set them up.

- remove all code related with Plone 2.1.

- setup of composable should happen in composite_tool rather than in
  kupu_library_tool

- viewlets should use macros (to structure a bit the HTML included), named
  "portlet" (to be able to reuse portlets as well).

- createCompoFragment and createCompoTitle cause problems when another
  user deleted the navigation page and the current user tried to add
  Title or HTML. When the user tries to add content, he gets a
  javascript error (unknown origin).

plone 2.1 compat
================

  * smart ids

  * replace layouts by templatemixin ?

Plone 2.5 compatibility
=======================

  * Viewlets can not be added using the ZMI (you get a login screen)

  * Added import_step for fixing up the azax layer in portal_skins
    (currently works only through QuickInstaller).

Plone 4.1 compatibility
======================

  * [KNOWN BUG] Object properties for Types in profiles/default/types are not
    being taken into consideration when installing, causing issues such as
    the 'cp_view' not being registered as the default view for Navigation
    Pages.

  * [KNOWN BUG] Kupu is hard-coded into the HTML Fragments editing view.
